Consortium Agreement
====================

This document explains the commitments of each of the parties involved in the pre-SWOT launch Adopt-A-Crossover ocean model inter-comparison study (hereon SWOT-AdAC).

The study is organised by `Takaya Uchida <https://roxyboy.github.io/>`_ and `Julien Le Sommer <http://lesommer.github.io/>`_

 * Agreeing to share the model data within the group of participants for the SWOT-AdAC study;
 * Agreeing that the data and code will be accessible to all the group members through a cloud-based Jupyterhub;
 * Agreeing to acquire explicit consent from each data provider for any other use of their data outside of SWOT-AdAC study;
 * Providing at least one GitHub username per data provider for internal communication.

In return, Takaya Uchida and Julien Le Sommer commit to :
 * Requesting explicit consent from each of the collaborators for any communication coming from the study (including presentations for CLIVAR OMDP and SWOT Science Team);
 * Providing co-authorship to each data provider for any scientific publication coming from the SWOT-AdAC work;
 * Being open to any suggestion and ideas regarding the analysis of the model data and the interpretation of the results.
