SWOT Adopt-A-Xover ocean model intercomparison study
====================================================

With the upcoming launch of the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite in 2021
and advent of submesoscale-permitting basin-scale simulations,
we would like to formulate a baseline
to compare the upcoming observations of submesoscale turbulence.
The models we currently have in mind are summarized in the following table
but feel free to reach out to us by raising an
`issue on Github <https://github.com/roxyboy/SWOT-AdAC-ocean-model-intercomparison/issues>`_
if you would like to contribute with your dataset.
